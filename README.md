# Chat-Room-using-TCP-IP--with-Tkinter-

##  *Description of the Project* 

1. A simple Project made using python and tkinter module for communication.
2. The server can kick or ban the client(s).
3. Threading module has been used so that multiple clients can connect to the same server.
4. Server can send message to individual client or it can broadcast the messages to all the clients.
5. Client can choose a color so that each time a client sends the message, it appears in a different color.
6. Eventually client can disconnect anytime.
